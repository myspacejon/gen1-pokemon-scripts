; Routine: CloneWRAMBoxtoSRAMBox2
;
; Purpose: Clones Pok√©mon in the currently selected box to Box 2. Box 2 is
;          overwritten in this process.
; 
; Method:  Clones the box currently loaded in WRAM ($DA80) into Box 2 of
;          the SRAM ($A462) and then updates all necessary checksums to
;          ensure the save file remains valid.
