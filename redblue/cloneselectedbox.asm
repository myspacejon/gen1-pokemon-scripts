; Routine: CloneWRAMBoxtoSRAMBox2
;
; Purpose: Clones Pok√©mon in the currently selected box to Box 2. Box 2 is
;          overwritten in this process.
; 
; Notes:   We intentionally omit checksum calculations and the write to
;          set banking mode, as they are not validated or required by the
;          game. See commit e4b5eaac0f03b43a513d3cdfd20f85d46ce97cb0 for reference.
